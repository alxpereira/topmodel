The shared dependencies between the files "./requirements.txt", "./setup.py", "./Pipfile", and "./Pipfile.lock" are the Python packages and their versions. These files are used to manage and install Python dependencies for a project. 

1. Python Package Names: These are the names of the Python libraries that the project depends on. They are shared across all four files.

2. Python Package Versions: These are the specific versions of the Python libraries that the project depends on. They are shared across all four files.

There are no exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names shared between these files as they are not relevant to Python dependency management.
