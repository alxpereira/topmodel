# This is a placeholder file and does not contain actual Python code.
# The actual content of this file will be dynamically generated based on the latest versions of the dependencies.

# The format of this file is:
# <package-name>==<package-version>

# For example:
# numpy==1.21.2
# pandas==1.3.3
# scipy==1.7.1
# matplotlib==3.4.3
# scikit-learn==0.24.2

# To update the dependencies to the latest versions, you would need to run the following command in your terminal:
# pip freeze > requirements.txt

# This command will overwrite this file with the latest versions of the installed packages in your current Python environment.
